## Responsive images in HTML

Responsive images in HTML are a method for providing the browser with multiple image sources for an image slot. The browser selects an image, depending on display density, size of the image element in the page, or any number of other factors. 

The following selection methods are available:


### Device-pixel-ratio-based selection

**Resolution switching for displaying an image with a fixed size while supporting different screen resolutions.**

The `img` element's `sizes` and `srcset` attributes are used in conjunction with the `x` descriptor.

Use this selection method if the rendered size of the image is fixed (e.g. by `height` and `width` attributes on the `img` element. The images in `srcset` only vary in their intrinsic width to support different resolutions (image content is identical).

Browsers which do not support the `sizes` and `srcset` attributes will ignore them and load the image referenced in the `src` attribute.


### Viewport-based selection

**Resolution switching for displaying different sizes of an image.**

The `img` element's `sizes` and `srcset` attributes are used in conjunction with the `w` descriptor. 

The images only vary in their size (image content is identical).

Browsers which do not support the `sizes` and `srcset` attributes will ignore them and load the image referenced in the `src` attribute.


### Art direction-based selection

**Resolution switching for displaying different image sizes and contents.**

The `picture` elements `source` element's `media` and `srcset` attributes reference different image sources for the browser to choose from. 

The images may not only vary in their size but also image content may not be identical.

Browsers which do not support the `picture` and `source` elements will ignore them and load the image referenced in the `img` elements `src` attribute.


## Responsive images in CSS

Responsive images in CSS can be implemented with the help of media queries (`@media`). The browser picks the image that matches the media query.

Browsers which do not support `@media` will ignore the rules.

## Terminologies

* **Art direction**  
  Images in the `srcset` show different images suitable for different space allocations.
* **CSS pixel**  
  A measurement unit. CSS pixels are hardware pixels divided by pixel density.
* **Device pixel ratio (DPR)**  
  Ratio between hardware pixels and logical pixels.
* **Hardware pixel**  
  An individual dot of light in the display.
* **Intrinsic width**  
  The real size of an image.
* **Physical pixel**  
  See _Hardware pixel_.
* **Pixel density**  
  The number of pixels present per inch on a display. The density is measured in Pixels Per Inch (PPI).
* **Resolution switching**  
  All images in the `srcset` show the same thing but contain different numbers of pixels.
* **Software pixel**  
  See _CSS pixel_.


## Examples

Examples of different usages of responsive images can be found in `/examples`.
